# VersionControlAssignment
Version control assignment
This project to being used to demonstrate an understanding of version control software. The project being controlled was submitted as part of a Developing Information Systems assignment. The assignment did not allow the use of JavaScript, however there are some changes I would like to make to the project to allow the navigational bar to be available from one location rather than in each page. Also the feedback form doesnâ€™t work so would like to add functionality to send the feedback as an email to HRD.
