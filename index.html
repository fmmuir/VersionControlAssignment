	  <h2>Halliburton's 100th Anniversary</h2> 
	  
	 
		<p> Halliburton is proud to be celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of 
		products and services to the energy industry. Halliburton's fascinating and proud history reveals a continuous focus on innovation and expansion that began with the company's founder, 
		Erle P. Halliburton. After borrowing a wagon, a team of mules and a pump, he built a wooden mixing box and started an oil well cementing business in Duncan, Oklahoma. </p> 
		
		<p> What started with a single product from a single location is now a global enterprise. We are proud to celebrate a 100 years of innovation, collaboration, and execution. To learn more click on the 100 icon above.</p>
